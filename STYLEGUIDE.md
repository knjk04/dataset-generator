# Git

All commits follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
For simplicity, this project uses a [strict subset](https://github.com/knjk04/covid19/blob/main/.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml#L20) of prefixes.

# Python

- All Python packages are pinned to a specific version in a `requirements.txt` file
